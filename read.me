Greetings!

Thanks for checking out my project. This was my first project completed during my full stack web development immersive at Galvanize.

I was inspired to make this app after a summer playing PokemonGo and realizing the power that real-world data provides for games.

It was a lot of fun using the Google Maps API to build an app that harnesses that power.

I plan to expand on this idea, adding more functionality with AngularJS. Check back for version two in the near future.
